## Setup

### 1. Get Google OAuth Credentials

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project (or select existing)
3. Search for **"Gmail API"** and **Enable** it
4. Go to **APIs & Services** → **OAuth consent screen**
   - Choose **External**
   - Fill in App name: "Gmail Cleanup" (or anything)
   - Add your email as **Test user**
5. Go to **Credentials** → **Create Credentials** → **OAuth 2.0 Client ID**
   - Application type: **Desktop app**
   - Download the JSON file
   - Rename to `credentials.json`

### 2. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Gururagavendra/gmail-cleaner.git
cd gmail-cleaner
```

Put your `credentials.json` file in the project folder.

## Usage

### Option A: Docker (Recommended)

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Open http://localhost:8766 in your browser.

**First-time sign-in:** Click "Sign In" in the web UI, then check logs for the OAuth URL:
```bash
docker logs cleanup_email-gmail-cleaner-1
```

Copy the URL from logs, open in browser, and authorize.

### Option B: Python (with uv)

```bash
uv sync
uv run python main.py
```

The app opens at http://localhost:8766

## Security & Privacy

- ✅ **100% Local** - No external servers, no data collection
- ✅ **Open Source** - Inspect all the code yourself
- ✅ **Minimal Permissions** - Only requests read + modify (for mark as read)
- ✅ **Your Credentials** - You control your own Google OAuth app
- ✅ **Gitignored Secrets** - `credentials.json` and `token.json` never get committed

## FAQ

**Q: Why do I need to create my own Google Cloud project?**
> Because this app accesses your Gmail. By using your own OAuth credentials, you have full control and don't need to trust a third party.

**Q: Is this safe?**
> Yes! The code is open source - you can inspect it. Your emails are processed locally on your machine.

**Q: Can I use this for multiple Gmail accounts?**
> Yes! Click "Sign Out" and sign in with a different account. Each account needs to be added as a test user in your Google Cloud project.

**Q: Emails went to Trash, can I recover them?**
> Yes! The delete feature moves emails to Trash. Go to Gmail → Trash to recover within 30 days.
